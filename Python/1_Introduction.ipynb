    " * Large community and resources: Python has a large and active community of users, developers, and contributors. This means that there is a wealth of resources available, including libraries, tools, and tutorials.\n",
    " * Interoperable with other languages: Python can easily integrate with other programming languages, making it a great choice for projects that require the use of multiple languages.\n",
    " * High-level programming: Python is a high-level programming language, which means that it abstracts away many of the lower-level details of programming. This makes it easier to write complex programs, and to focus on the logic and behavior of your code, rather than on the underlying details.\n",
    " * Dynamically typed: Python is dynamically typed, which means that you don't need to declare the type of a variable when you use it. This makes it easier to write flexible and reusable code."
