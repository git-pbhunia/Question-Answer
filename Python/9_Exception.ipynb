    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception is encountered, the program stops executing and Python raises an exception object, which contains information about the type of error that occurred and where it occurred in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, occur when there is a problem with the syntax of the program, such as a missing or misplaced character or an incorrect use of a keyword. These errors are detected by the Python interpreter when the code is being compiled, and the program will not even start executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that exceptions occur during the execution of the program, while syntax errors occur before the program starts running. Additionally, syntax errors are usually easier to fix since the interpreter provides a clear error message that indicates the location of the error, whereas exceptions can be more difficult to diagnose since they may be caused by a variety of factors, such as unexpected input or external dependencies."
